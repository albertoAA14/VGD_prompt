Today, I learned about literal data types in C# and how to use them in Console.WriteLine(). These data types help define the kind of data Iâ€™m working with, which prevents errors and improves clarity in my code.

  Console.WriteLine('b');
Console.WriteLine(123);
Console.WriteLine(0.25F);
Console.WriteLine(true);
Console.WriteLine(false);
